The Crime Tracer -- `TODO' starts here.

Todo:

  * The error messages should always be
    printed regardless of verbose value

  * Informative messages should be printed
    only when verbose flag is set to false

  * Get help from PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code

  * Make the `meny.py' class sprite-based

The Crime Tracer -- `TODO' ends here.
